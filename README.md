# Project-Ideas-Hub
It is safe to say that at some point in a developers life, when you're done going through tutorials and PDF's, we usually ask ourselves one question. I'm i good enough? It's only after you get a project that you realize not everything was taught in the tutorials and its back to the drawing board ;-(.  Worry not (both newbies &amp; Veterans) we have taken it upon ourselves to publish projects ranging from Beginner to Intermediate and Expert. Our goal is for you to develop the projects and use our code as a reference point in case you're stuck. :-)
